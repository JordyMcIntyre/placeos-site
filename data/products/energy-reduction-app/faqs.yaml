    - question: What features does the energy management system offer?
      answer: >-
        The solution integrates with building management systems (BMS), lighting,
        HVAC, and in-room devices to provide real-time data on energy consumption
        and optimize usage based on occupancy data.
    - question: How does the energy management system help in reducing energy usage?
      answer: >-
        It uses automation workflows to control lighting, HVAC, and other devices
        based on occupancy or scheduling data. If the space isn't being used, it
        can turn everything off.
    - question: >-
        Can the energy management system integrate with existing building systems
        like BMS?
      answer: >-
        Yes, the app can connect building systems to tenancy systems. It
        integrates with the following building management systems (BMS): BACnet
        Secure Connect, Johnson Controls Metasys, Siemens Desigo, and Delta
        Controls.
    - question: Does the energy management system offer real-time monitoring?
      answer: >-
        Yes, it provides tools for real-time monitoring and historical trend
        analysis of energy consumption.
    - question: What kind of analytics does the energy management system provide?
      answer: >-
        The energy management system tracks energy trends, identifies high
        consumption areas, generates usage reports, and links occupancy with
        energy consumption to optimize operational costs.
    - question: Is it possible to automate control of lighting and HVAC?
      answer: >-
        Yes, the energy management system allows for automation of lighting, HVAC
        (BMS), and other devices to enhance energy efficiency.
    - question: Can I set alerts for unusual energy consumption?
      answer: >-
        Yes, the energy management system allows you to set alerts for unusual
        energy consumption patterns.
    - question: What kind of insights can I gain from the energy management system?
      answer: >-
        The energy management system provides insights into energy consumption
        patterns by showcasing comparisons to occupancy and energy usage, helping
        to identify inefficiencies and optimize energy use.
