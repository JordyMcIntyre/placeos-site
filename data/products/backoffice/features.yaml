        Bring all your smart building logic into one configuration tree:
        - Mirror your environment with Zones (Org → Building → Level)
        - Attach Systems to real rooms, floors, and functions
        - Group drivers, logic, and metadata that represent how spaces behave

    - name: "Manage integrations like a product team"
      description: |
        Add, update, and roll back PlaceOS drivers and interfaces from GitHub/GitLab—no CLI needed:
        - Test new branches without affecting production
        - Pin drivers to specific commits
        - Compile and view errors in the UI

    - name: "Add and configure drivers"
      description: |
        Drivers are reusable modules for devices and cloud services:
        - Load any driver from your connected repo
        - Configure once at the driver level and reuse across systems
        - View build status and recompile from the UI

    - name: "Attach logic to the physical world"
      description: |
        Zones let you model the built environment digitally:
        - Attach maps to levels (SVG)
        - Bind features to spaces via metadata
        - Control what users see in front-end apps via zone-level config

    - name: "Create and maintain systems"
      description: |
        A system is a functional unit—like a meeting room or tracking setup:
        - Combine drivers, logic, and metadata
        - Inherit settings from parent zones
        - Connect back to maps and interfaces

    - name: "Create event-driven automation"
      description: |
        Triggers let you define behavior across your entire PlaceOS deployment:
        - If no one checks into a room → release the booking
        - If occupancy hits 0 → turn off HVAC
        - If a driver goes offline → notify the team

    - name: "Manage users, domains and auth"
      description: |
        Control access and surface the right experiences:
        - Define OAuth providers (Azure, Google, etc.)
        - Map sub-apps like Workplace or Concierge to your domains
        - Grant per-domain access to specific users or groups
