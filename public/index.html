      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <div class="list-summary">Open, agnostic, and built for extensibility. Like WordPress or Salesforce, you can build solutions on top, plug in components, or buy something off the shelf (more on that below). You don’t buy a fixed app. You get a foundation. Build your own workflows, or start with one of ours. Platforms let others build — that’s the difference.</div>

        <div class="list-summary"><p>Hardcoded apps pretending to be flexible. The term &quot;platform&quot; gets thrown around a lot. But most of the time, it doesn’t mean what it should. A true platform separates logic from the interface. It has modular integrations, open APIs, and allows others to build on top. The interface can be anything — but the smarts, logic, and automation all live in the backend.</p>
<p>Vendors often call their single-use apps “platforms.” A room booking app where everything is hardcoded? Not a platform. A dashboard that only connects to its own ecosystem? Still not a platform. If you can’t build on it or extend it without asking permission or signing an NDA — it’s not a platform. Salesforce is a platform. WordPress is a platform. You can build on them, resell your version, or plug in your own tools. That’s what PlaceOS is too. A platform isn’t just about where it runs — it’s about what it enables. If it locks you in, it’s not a platform. Hardcoded apps. Fixed dashboards. Tools that only work with their own ecosystem. That’s not a platform — that’s vendor lock-in.</p>

        <div class="list-summary">An abstraction layer with hot-swappable modules. PlaceOS creates an abstraction layer between your integrations and your logic — so you can swap tech in and out without breaking anything.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <div class="list-summary"><p>We’ve built apps like WorkMate that are ready to go. An app solves the obvious stuff, bundling up common problems in one place. Tapping into your phone’s native tech like Bluetooth, NFC, and Ultra-Wideband for access and location.
But that’s just the surface. We go beyond with deep integrations, smart workflows, and modular interfaces.
Our apps sit on top of the platform architecture so receive all the same benefits of hot-swappable modules and logic. When the next interface drops, glasses, wearables, or whatever OpenAI’s cooking, we’ll be there. Because we’ve decoupled the front-end from the brains, making the experience future-proof, flexible and device-agnostic.
Here are our apps:
<strong>WorkMate</strong>: The first workplace management system to combine out-of-the-box simplicity with enterprise-level configuration &amp; scalability.</p>
<p><strong>StageHand</strong>: Remote AV control that works without third-party controllers.</p>
<p><strong>VirtualCare</strong>: Gives clinicians, carers, and patients one system to manage consults, surveys, referrals, Medicare billing, education, and follow-ups — no plugins or patchwork tools.</p>
<p><strong>Room booking</strong> (Free): Search, view, and book rooms based on availability, size, features, and location.</p>
<p><strong>Room booking</strong> (Basic): Works with every calendar tool, conferencing system, occupancy sensor, AV equipment and network.</p>
<p><strong>Desk booking</strong>: Configurable desk booking management at scale — no hardware lock-in.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor management</strong>: So simple, the only thing you do is send the invite — it does everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Occupancy-based energy</strong>: Align energy use in spaces with actual occupancy to reduce HVAC &amp; lighting use.</p>

        <div class="list-summary">We’d love that. Honestly, it’s a better move than getting locked into some rigid, hard-coded app. But we think we can give you the best of both worlds: a head start that lets you focus on your unique challenges without getting buried in device-level protocol hell.
Our integration drivers don’t just connect you to hundreds of vendors, we also support the protocols that make smart buildings actually smart: BACnet, Modbus, KNX, and more. We handle the heavy lifting, device integrations, zone management, system coordination, so you can get straight to building.
Now your scoping exercise changes: What do you want to build, knowing you can connect everything you need?
Take it from there. Extend with new drivers. Contribute to our open source libraries. Talk to us about using a non-commercial version for that side project you’ve been meaning to automate.
