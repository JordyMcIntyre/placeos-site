        </div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <div class="list-summary">At its core, PlaceOS is built to connect. Most building systems are siloed. HVAC, AV, calendars, access control and sensors all speak different languages. PlaceOS creates an abstraction layer across them, turning those scattered systems into usable building blocks. Once connected, they can serve as inputs and outputs in any workflow—like presence detection triggering HVAC changes, or badge swipes triggering security footage events. That’s what makes it a platform: not just a tool, but an integration layer that drives outcomes.</div>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <div class="list-summary">You&rsquo;d be surprised by what data you can extract from existing systems. For example, most people go straight to new sensor rollouts when thinking about occupancy but your Wi-Fi network may already hold most of what you need. That’s why we recommend auditing what you’ve got first. More often than not, you don’t need new sensors. You need the siloed systems to talk to each other.</div>

          <div class="list-summary">It’s a philosophy: open, agnostic, and designed for extensibility. Like WordPress or Salesforce, you can build solutions on top, plug in components, or use something off the shelf. But unlike single-use tools, PlaceOS gives you a foundation to connect systems, build logic and automate workflows. You get to shape the experience without rebuilding it every time the interface or you hardware changes.~</div>

          <div class="list-summary"><p>Every integration starts here. Drivers connect PlaceOS to your systems like access control, AV, HVAC, sensors, network and calendars. This is where we connect and abstract.</p>
<p>There are two types of drivers, integration &amp; logic.</p>
<p>Integration drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with external systems and lets them talk to PlaceOS.</li>
<li>Represent hardware or software platforms (i.e. device or service).</li>
<li>Control any functionality of the external systems and handle any incoming data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logic drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinate interactions between modules</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t map to specific physical objects</li>
<li>Represent abstract or conceptual functions</li>
<li>May use a variety of devices or software platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>They’re also open source so you can build your own or use what’s already in the library. See our integration list <a href="https://docs.placeos.com/reference/supported-integrations">here</a>.</p>

          <div class="list-summary">Modules are reusable building blocks, each one is a live instance of a driver. It could represent a device, a digital service, or a set of logic. Modules control both state (like power status or user presence) and behavior (like powering on a display or creating a booking).
Each can be started or stopped individually, and reused across systems. That means shared infrastructure, like a lighting gateway or AV switch, doesn’t need to be rebuilt for every room. Logic modules are special: they don’t talk to external systems, they coordinate internal actions and inherit settings from zones and systems for consistent behavior.</div>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <div class="list-summary">Systems are the building blocks that tie together devices, services, and logic. Each system groups modules, settings and metadata, typically representing a physical space like a room, or a logical function like digital signage. Zones are collections of systems that share characteristics, like being part of the same floor, building, or function.
Zones help you apply shared settings across groups, while systems manage the localized logic and integrations. You can apply broad logic at the zone level (like building-wide HVAC behavior) and tailor specifics within each system. This structure lets you scale from one room to hundreds consistently, and without rewriting everything.</div>

          <div class="list-summary">Triggers add dynamic, event-driven behavior across modules without writing complex logic. They define actions that occur based on conditions like system state, time, or external input (like a webhook).
Triggers let modules react to each other. For example, turning on AV when a room is booked, or posting a chat message when someone badges in. You can create and manage them directly in the PlaceOS Backoffice to customize real-time system behavior or use them to complement more advanced workflows powered by logic modules.</div>

But that’s just the surface. We go beyond with deep integrations, smart workflows, and modular interfaces.
Our apps sit on top of the platform architecture so receive all the same benefits of hot-swappable modules and logic. When the next interface drops, glasses, wearables, or whatever OpenAI’s cooking, we’ll be there. Because we’ve decoupled the front-end from the brains, making the experience future-proof, flexible and device-agnostic.
Here are our apps:
<strong>WorkMate</strong>: The first workplace management system to combine out-of-the-box simplicity with enterprise-level configuration &amp; scalability.</p>
<p><strong>StageHand</strong>: Remote AV control that works without third-party controllers.</p>
<p><strong>VirtualCare</strong>: Gives clinicians, carers, and patients one system to manage consults, surveys, referrals, Medicare billing, education, and follow-ups — no plugins or patchwork tools.</p>
<p><strong>Room booking</strong> (Free): Search, view, and book rooms based on availability, size, features, and location.</p>
<p><strong>Room booking</strong> (Basic): Works with every calendar tool, conferencing system, occupancy sensor, AV equipment and network.</p>
<p><strong>Desk booking</strong>: Configurable desk booking management at scale — no hardware lock-in.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor management</strong>: So simple, the only thing you do is send the invite — it does everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Occupancy-based energy</strong>: Align energy use in spaces with actual occupancy to reduce HVAC &amp; lighting use.</p>

          <div class="list-summary">We’d love that. Honestly, it’s a better move than getting locked into some rigid, hard-coded app. But we think we can give you the best of both worlds: a head start that lets you focus on your unique challenges without getting buried in device-level protocol hell.
Our integration drivers don’t just connect you to hundreds of vendors, we also support the protocols that make smart buildings actually smart: BACnet, Modbus, KNX, and more. We handle the heavy lifting, device integrations, zone management, system coordination, so you can get straight to building.
Now your scoping exercise changes: What do you want to build, knowing you can connect everything you need?
Take it from there. Extend with new drivers. Contribute to our open source libraries. Talk to us about using a non-commercial version for that side project you’ve been meaning to automate.
We’re built for developers. Everything you need is available on <a href="https://github.com/PlaceOS">GitHub</a> &amp; our <a href="https://docs.placeos.com/">Docs</a></div>

          <div class="list-summary">PlaceOS is developed almost entirely in <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>, a modern programming language that blends the elegance of Ruby with the performance of C. We chose Crystal because it lets us move fast without compromising reliability. It gives our team the confidence of a typed language, the flexibility to build reusable services, and the performance to scale from a single room to enterprise-wide deployments.
Our backend stack is fully Crystal—from open source drivers to our web framework <a href="https://github.com/spider-gazelle">Spider-Gazelle</a>. This lets us generate accurate API documentation automatically, run efficiently on minimal infrastructure, and support lightweight edge deployments that work even in bandwidth-constrained environments.
It’s one of the reasons PlaceOS feels fast, stable and consistent—whether it’s running in the cloud, on-prem, or directly on a network switch.</div>
