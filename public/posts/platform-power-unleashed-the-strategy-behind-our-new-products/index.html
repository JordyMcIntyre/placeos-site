</h4>
<p>At its core, a platform business model is fundamentally different from a traditional SaaS (Software as a Service) company. While SaaS companies typically offer a fixed, standalone application designed to solve specific problems, platforms are designed for flexibility. Think of SaaS as a well-crafted tool, like a Swiss Army knifeâ€”versatile but limited by its pre-defined functions. While it can handle a variety of tasks, its capabilities are confined to what has been explicitly designed and coded, making it less adaptable to new, unforeseen requirements. This limits scalability, as expanding its functionality often requires significant redevelopment. In contrast, a platform can seamlessly integrate new tools and features, allowing it to evolve quickly as business needs change. A platform is like an entire workshop, equipped with tools that can be combined, customized, and expanded to build anything you can imagine.</p>
<p>The major advantage of a platform is that the &ldquo;smarts&rdquo; or intelligence are embedded in the back-end, not hardcoded into individual applications. This means that instead of building and maintaining separate, rigid apps for every new use case, we can rapidly develop new products simply by connecting and configuring existing components. Our combinations and packages solve targeted problems, but their true strength is in their evolution.</p>
<p>A platform with modular packages isnâ€™t limited to a single approachâ€”it can support diverse business models, including SaaS, consumption-based pricing, and strategic joint ventures with other vendors. Thereâ€™s even a resurgence of one-off payments for enterprise software, which could be a viable model for specific PlaceOS packages in the future. 37 Signals has an excellent website exploring this shift <a href="https://once.com/">https://once.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SaaS still makes sense for many products, but its grip will slip. Installation and administration used to be hopelessly complicated, but selfâ€“hosting tech is simpler now and vastly improved. Plus, IT departments are hungry to run their own IT again, tired of being subservient to Big Techâ€™s reign clouds. - <strong>37Signals</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This flexibility ensures that as market demands shift, these solutions can adapt seamlessly, driving continuous value for both providers and customers.</p>

<p>Our platform (PlaceOS) is designed for rapid development. With <a href="https://docs.placeos.com/reference/supported-integrations">hundreds of integration drivers</a> already in place, creating a new product often comes down to combining existing components in new ways. Think of it like LEGO bricks: the pieces are ready; all it takes is a fresh perspective to build something innovative.</p>
<p>Unlike SaaS-only solutions, where adding new features can require extensive coding and re-deployment, platforms enable faster iteration and scalability. The intelligence is centralized, making it easier to adapt, integrate, and evolve without starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Each integration driver connects with a specific system, technology, or service. When you have hundreds of these drivers, the potential combinations are vast. Even just the combination of two PlaceOS drivers can form the basis of a new product, addressing niche needs or creating entirely new markets.</p>
<p>For example, integrating building access control with security cameras can create a system that identifies and tracks who enters the building, with user ID metadata automatically linked to corresponding video footage for easy review. Furthermore, this metadata can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of computer vision models. This is a niche example, but itâ€™s a real-world use case from one of our projectsâ€”and one of my favorite demonstrations of PlaceOS as a connective service, seamlessly operating without the need for a user interface.</p>
<p>This requires just two drivers to demonstrate the value of enhanced security and provide better insights into building usage. You can start by combining any of our existing driversâ€”and, of course, develop new ones as needed.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting opportunities that a platform-based business model unlocks is the integration of AI agents. These agents act as dynamic connectors, automating workflows, making real-time decisions, and optimizing operations based on the data flowing through the platform.</p>
<p>Being a platform-based business means we&rsquo;re inherently AI agent-ready. The intelligence isnâ€™t confined to hardcoded applications; instead, AI agents can tap into the platformâ€™s core capabilities, leveraging the integration drivers to perform complex tasks across multiple systems. If every function of every PlaceOS integration driver is exposed to the agent, it can decide when to call the functionâ€”without this functionality needing to be programmed into an application.</p>

<p>Why now? The demand for integration-based products has never been higher. The market is primed for solutions that bridge gaps between systems, making this the perfect moment to capitalize on our platform&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
<p>While COVID-19 may feel like a distant memory, it served as a powerful reminder of the critical need for flexibility in technology solutions. The demands of users are incredibly diverseâ€”ranging from audiovisual automation to building system optimization. This is where a platform truly shines. It offers the adaptability to support a wide array of user interfaces, applications, and tailored solutions for each stakeholder, ensuring resilience and responsiveness in an ever-changing landscape.</p>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to entry for broad platform-based solutions has traditionally been the rigid purchasing processes of enterprise, university, and government clients. However, this landscape is evolving. We&rsquo;re increasingly seeing tenders that prioritize a platform-based approach over a strict checklist of features. The market is maturing, recognizing that it&rsquo;s impossible to anticipate every need upfrontâ€”solutions must be flexible enough to adapt to tomorrow&rsquo;s challenges as they arise.</p>
<p>Additionally, the perception of &ldquo;nice-to-have&rdquo; versus &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; features is shifting. The features that were once considered optional are now the differentiators that set solutions apart. Starting with these features not only delights customers but also establishes a competitive edge, while the foundational functionalities are simply expected as standard.</p>
