<p>In preparation for their new office space, Suncorp recognized that they were not perceived as technology innovators and decided to take action. They embarked on a research mission to determine what their ideal technological infrastructure would look like, and then worked backward to identify which specific technologies would help them achieve that goal. Their ultimate objective was to create a system that could serve as the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of their new building.</p>
<p>Suncorp had observed that there were numerous manual processes in place, and a vast amount of data was being generated, but very little of it was being used to derive meaningful insights.</p>

<p>The opening of Heritage Lanes also introduced Suncorpâs @MyOffice app, which employees use for this purpose, as well as their digital ID for gaining access.
