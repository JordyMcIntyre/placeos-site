# We use occupancy to make energy efficient commercial buildings

PlaceOS monitors occupancy in real time to dynamically manage the environment in spaces you're using, so that you don't have to worry about heating, cooling, lighting & powering spaces people aren't in.

## Energy consumption challenges

### High energy consumption

Commercial buildings consume [40%](https://www.architecture2030.org/why-the-built-environment/) of global energy. New regulations are emerging worldwide. Reducing energy use is critical. HVAC systems are responsible for [40%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXSFGL_Ubd8) of energy consumption in commercial real estate buildings.

### Government mandates

Governments around the globe are implementing new laws and regulations that give energy ratings to buildings and more importantly, affect the bottom line. [Local Law 97](https://www.nyc.gov/site/buildings/codes/ll97-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reductions.page#:~:text=Local%20Law%2097%20of%202019,coming%20into%20effect%20in%202030.) in New York City for example, it fines organizations per square foot that don’t meet their standards. In the UK, the government is [stopping building owners from leasing their building](https://www.placeos.com/blog/ps93bn-of-commercial-real-estate-is-at-risk-heres-what-to-do) it's not rated an "E" or higher. By 2027, it'll be "C", and by 2030 you'll need a rating of "B".

### High office vacancy rates

People are working from home [28%](https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WFHResearch_updates_May2023.pdf) of the time, with an average workplace utilization of [35%](https://xysense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Workplace-Utilization-Index-Q214-Benchmarks-XY-Sense.pdf), down from 65% pre-pandemic. Businesses are looking for ways to repurpose the unused space but face significant challenges when it comes to implementing such a solution and tackling utilization.

## Occupancy-based energy automation

PlaceOS integrates with calendar software, IoT, network systems, building systems, endpoints, and collaborative tools. By connecting these elements, we bridge the gap between the tools you use for work and the building systems that support you.  
  
Other workplace applications are limited by their hard-coded solutions. Our flexibility lies in our integrations. Meaning you're not tied down to specific hardware providers or if something is missing, we can integrate with it.

## Integrate energy & occupancy

Facilitate energy and occupancy integration by connecting building systems to tenancy systems, running lighting on PoE network switches with control capabilities, and incorporating energy management workflows into existing systems.

## Monitor energy trends

Track and analyze energy consumption with tools for real-time monitoring and historical trend analysis. Identify high consumption areas, generate energy usage reports, and understand the link between occupancy and energy consumption to optimize operational costs.

## Improve energy use

Enhance energy efficiency through automation. Control lighting, HVAC, and in-room devices remotely, set alerts for unusual energy consumption, and use occupancy or scheduling data to automate control of lighting, HVAC, and more.
