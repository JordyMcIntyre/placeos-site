WorkMate is the most configurable workplace management software, built for enterprise HR, IT, and Facilities teams. Its architecture ensures a consistent user experience, even as building systems or business software evolve. Administrators can easily implement and configure rules for entire buildings, meeting rooms, desks, parking spaces and more, tailoring each location to its unique needs while operating at a global scale.

## WorkMate does it all
Hundreds of offices around the world use PlaceOS for occupancy management, workplace experience, room management, utilization reportings, hot-desks, visitor management, building automation and energy savings. Hundred of apps can provide features like room and desk booking- but can they apply configurable rules and conditions while scaling across your entire global portfolio?

## Everything else is just an app

WorkMate's underlying architecture, PlaceOS, uses a platform approach. This means there is a decoupling of frontend and backend. With modular integrations, you can switch hardware providers, move into new buildings, or scale across multiple locations without changing the end user experience.

### They don't integrate with that

WorkMate has hundreds of integrations meaning we work with what you've got and what you'll have in the future. If we don’t already support what you need, we can build new drivers for your project.

### They're just a dashboard

Even if they integrate with some technology, the solution is often a dashboard for data, it lacks action. WorkMate takes that a step further and provides you with the ability to automate actions based on using the real-time data we collect.

### They can't scale across buildings

Scaling is hard when each building has different BMS, access control and systems. Our integrations mean we can cater for expansion without affecting experience.

### They lock you into their hardware

Vendor lock-in means buying expensive, unsupported hardware. WorkMate is vendor-agnostic, running on any device, so you stay in control.

## What's the alternative?
### Workplace experience tools
These tools can provide you some or most of the same features in our WorkMate solution. However, they can't integrate with base building services  limiting their capability in areas like access control and climate control. Scaling across buildings with different systems affects the end user experience.
We've developed hundreds of integration drivers for every aspect of the building and your business. We integrate with access control, av control, network, authentication, active directory, messaging, resource booking, RTLS, sensors, BMS, lighting and more.

### Space analytics tools
These tools can provide you with great insights into how people use your space. What they can't do is take action for you. PlaceOS has an automation tool so the spaces react dynamically in real time to drive change.

### Room & desk booking tools
These apps are simple in nature. In order to achieve the complex needs of modern workplaces, they require you to lock-in with their hardware provider, meaning more expensive roll outs. WorkMate can achieve the same outcomes by integrating into your existing technology stack.

### Integrated workplace management systems
IWMS platforms provide robust tools for managing real estate, facilities and workplace operations. However, many are rigid, hard-coded systems that struggle to adapt to changing building technologies or business software. Their reliance on proprietary hardware often leads to vendor lock-ins, and scaling across diverse buildings can compromise the end-user experience—challenges WorkMate overcomes with its configurable, vendor-agnostic, and scalable architecture.

## Integration - Connect your business software to the building systems
We've developed hundreds of integration drivers for every aspect of the building and your business. We integrate with access control, av control, network, authentication, active directory, messaging, resource booking, RTLS, sensors, BMS, lighting and more.

## Building management - Apply standardized workplace settings across regions with tailored adjustments for each building
