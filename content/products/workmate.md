WorkMate is the most configurable workplace management software; purpose built for teams managing thousands of workplace resources – desks, rooms, assets, climate, and visitors – across global real estate portfolios. 

Its architecture ensures a consistent user experience, even as building systems or business software evolve. 

Administrators can easily implement and configure rules for entire buildings, meeting rooms, desks, parking spaces and more; tailoring each location to its unique needs while operating at a global scale.

## Spend less time managing apps and more time managing your workplace

You’ve invested in hot-desking software, visitor management apps, and space analytics dashboards. Yet, your systems don’t talk to each other. Your facilities team is manually adjusting climate controls, your IT team is buried in integration requests, and your employee experience is inconsistent from one building to the next.

These disconnected "solutions" create friction, waste energy, and prevent you from operating as a single, efficient organization. Point solutions can't solve a platform problem.

## WorkMate is different by design

Our unique platform architecture decouples the front-end user experience from the back-end integrations. This means you can change, upgrade and scale your physical and digital infrastructure without your users ever noticing.

### The other tools solve a slice of the problem
- **Legacy IWMS?** Rigid, slow, and hard to scale.  
- **Room & desk apps?** Shallow features and expensive hardware lock-in.  
- **Analytics dashboards?** Data without action.

### What makes PlaceOS unique

- **Modular architecture** – decouples UX from back-end systems so you can update hardware or software independently.  
- **Vendor-agnostic** – integrates with your existing systems, no lock-in.  
- **Enterprise-scale with local flexibility** – set global policies while tailoring local building needs.  
- **Real-time automation** – turn occupancy and booking data into live actions (lighting, HVAC, access, notifications).  
- **Deep integrations** – from BMS and AV to access control and HRIS.

## WorkMate's core capabilities

### Global & Local Configuration
Standardize policies across locations while allowing tailored adjustments for room booking, desk management, visitor access, and facility controls so that you can manage multiple buildings with unique settings at scale.

### Resource Booking
Book rooms, desks, lockers, parking, and end-of-trip facilities with customizable rules and centralized management. Support flexible work while optimizing space usage.

### Environmental, Access & AV Automation
Automate lighting, HVAC, and AV based on occupancy and bookings. Tie building access to calendars, permissions, or room assignments – no manual toggling or vendor lock-in.

For example: when a room is no longer in use, WorkMate can release the booking, shut off lighting and HVAC, and notify cleaning staff – all automatically.

### Visitor & Event Management
Manage the entire visitor experience from pre-registration to check-in. Coordinate events with room availability, catering, and access in one integrated workflow.
