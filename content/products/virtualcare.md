## Integrations & Automation

PlaceOS has an extensive library of integrations. TeleHealth includes the most common conferencing systems and devices to enable the suite of features. These integrations are hot-swappable, so you could even change your software vendor to another supported integration, and the system will continue to operate. Or you might use different integrations across multiple regions.   
  
We can enable automation beyond the front-end interface with a direct connection to your systems and devices. Why push a button when we can automate? Want to trigger an action when a certain condition is met?
