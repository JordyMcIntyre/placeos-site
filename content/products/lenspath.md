**Fix problems the moment they're seen.** LensPath is the no-code computer vision automation platform that connects to your existing camera systems, detects events in real time, and triggers automated actions in your facility.

---

## Your most valuable data is hiding in plain sight

You have hundreds, maybe thousands, of cameras across your facilities. Right now, they’re passive observers—used to record incidents and review them later. This reactive approach means slow human response, high labor costs, and missed opportunities to prevent problems before they escalate.

What if your existing infrastructure could do the work for you, instantly?

## What LensPath Replaces

Most orgs use their cameras to *record* events. LensPath turns them into agents that *respond* to events. Use it to replace slow, manual workflows with instant, automated ones.

* Security staff manually monitoring screens
* Reports that trigger actions after the fact
* BI dashboards no one checks
* Expensive custom integrations for automation

## LensPath: automate what you see

LensPath empowers operations, security, and facilities teams to trigger real-world actions using what your cameras already see—without new hardware or writing code.

### From passive observation to automated action

**Replace manual monitoring with real-time response**  
Detect events like spills, unauthorized access, or vehicle arrivals and automatically trigger responses like cleaning dispatch, door unlocks, or security alerts.

**Build logic without writing code**  
Use a drag-and-drop workflow builder to link visual triggers to actions—like sending messages, adjusting lighting, or activating systems through PlaceOS.

**Test before you go live**  
Run your automations in simulation mode using live or recorded feeds. Validate logic, tune settings, and deploy with confidence.

**Use the cameras you already have**  
LensPath works with standard IP cameras and requires no vendor lock-in.
