# LensPath Your no-code computer vision automation layer for your existing camera systems

It watches what your cameras see and triggers real-world actions—without writing a line of code or buying new hardware.

## What LensPath Replaces

Most orgs use their cameras to *record* events.
LensPath turns them into agents that *respond* to events.
Use it to replace slow, manual workflows with instant, automated ones.

What it replaces:

* Security staff manually monitoring screens
* Reports that trigger actions after the fact
* BI dashboards no one checks
* Expensive custom integrations for automation

## Who It’s For

For operations teams, facilities managers, retail experience leads, safety officers—
Anyone tired of spot-checking footage or chasing people to react.
You have cameras. LensPath makes them useful.

Use cases include:

* Facility and cleaning automation
* Security event response
* Occupancy and movement triggers
* Customer recognition or loyalty activations

## What Makes It Different

* **No-code workflow builder**
  Drag and drop your logic without writing code
* **Simulation mode**
  Test scenarios before deploying in production
* **Custom + pre-trained vision models**
  Choose from a library or train your own
* **Works with what you already have**
  No new hardware. No vendor lock-in
* **Deep PlaceOS integration**
  Trigger anything PlaceOS can do—lighting, HVAC, alerts, access control

## What It Lets You Do

* Detect events in real time (people, behaviors, objects)
* Launch custom responses (alerts, notifications, systems)
* Chain visual events to real-world workflows
* Turn passive infrastructure into active automation

Your cameras see. LensPath acts.

## Common Questions

**Can I use my existing cameras?**
Yes. LensPath works with standard IP camera feeds.

**Do I need an engineer to set it up?**
No. If you can use a flowchart, you can use LensPath.

**Can I test before going live?**
Yes. Use simulation mode to preview and validate logic.

**Can it do X?**
If you can see it, you can usually detect it. And if PlaceOS can respond to it, LensPath can automate it.

This is not another AI demo video.
It’s live automation, triggered by vision, built for real facilities.
**Operational intelligence you can actually use.**
