**Fix problems the moment they're seen.** LensPath is the no-code computer vision automation platform that connects to your existing camera systems, detects events in real time, and triggers automated actions in your facility.

## Your most valuable data is hiding in plain sight

You have hundreds, maybe thousands, of cameras across your facilities. Right now, they’re passive observers—used to record incidents and review them later. This reactive approach means slow human response, high labor costs, and missed opportunities to prevent problems before they escalate.

What if your existing infrastructure could do the work for you, instantly?

## What LensPath Replaces

Most orgs use their cameras to *record* events. LensPath turns them into agents that *respond* to events. Use it to replace slow, manual workflows with instant, automated ones.

* Security staff manually monitoring screens
* Reports that trigger actions after the fact
* BI dashboards no one checks
* Expensive custom integrations for automation

## LensPath: automate what you see

LensPath empowers operations, security, and facilities teams to trigger real-world actions using what your cameras already see—without new hardware or writing code.

### From passive observation to automated action

**Replace manual monitoring with real-time response**  
Detect events like spills, unauthorized access, or vehicle arrivals and automatically trigger responses like cleaning dispatch, door unlocks, or security alerts.

**Build logic without writing code**  
Use a drag-and-drop workflow builder to link visual triggers to actions—like sending messages, adjusting lighting, or activating systems through PlaceOS.

**Test before you go live**  
Run your automations in simulation mode using live or recorded feeds. Validate logic, tune settings, and deploy with confidence.

**Use the cameras you already have**  
LensPath works with standard IP cameras and requires no vendor lock-in.

## Built for the teams who keep buildings running

**For Facilities & Operations**  
Dispatch cleaning based on foot traffic or spills. Adjust HVAC and lighting based on occupancy detected through video.

**For Security Teams**  
Detect unauthorized access, automate gate control, or get alerts on loitering and other suspicious behavior.

**For Customer & Visitor Experience Managers**  
Trigger greetings, personalized signage, or queue management without needing app installs or manual check-ins.

## Who It’s For

For operations teams, facilities managers, retail experience leads, safety officers—
Anyone tired of spot-checking footage or chasing people to react.
You have cameras. LensPath makes them useful.

Use cases include:

* Facility and cleaning automation
* Security event response
* Occupancy and movement triggers
* Customer recognition or loyalty activations

## What Makes It Different

* **No-code workflow builder**
  Drag and drop your logic without writing code
* **Simulation mode**
  Test scenarios before deploying in production
* **Custom + pre-trained vision models**
  Choose from a library or train your own
* **Works with what you already have**
  No new hardware. No vendor lock-in
* **Deep PlaceOS integration**
  Trigger anything PlaceOS can do—lighting, HVAC, alerts, access control

## What It Lets You Do

* Detect events in real time (people, behaviors, objects)
* Launch custom responses (alerts, notifications, systems)
* Chain visual events to real-world workflows
* Turn passive infrastructure into active automation

Your cameras see. LensPath acts.

## Common Questions

**Can I use my existing cameras?**
Yes. LensPath works with standard IP camera feeds.

**Do I need an engineer to set it up?**
No. If you can use a flowchart, you can use LensPath.

**Can I test before going live?**
Yes. Use simulation mode to preview and validate logic.

**Can it do X?**
If you can see it, you can usually detect it. And if PlaceOS can respond to it, LensPath can automate it.

This is not another AI demo video.
It’s live automation, triggered by vision, built for real facilities.
**Operational intelligence you can actually use.**
