faqs:
  - question: What features does the energy management system offer?
    answer: >-
      The solution integrates with building management systems (BMS), lighting,
      HVAC, and in-room devices to provide real-time data on energy consumption
      and optimize usage based on occupancy data.
  - question: How does the energy management system help in reducing energy usage?
    answer: >-
      It uses automation workflows to control lighting, HVAC, and other devices
      based on occupancy or scheduling data. If the space isn't being used, it
      can turn everything off.
  - question: >-
      Can the energy management system integrate with existing building systems
      like BMS?
    answer: >-
      Yes, the app can connect building systems to tenancy systems. It
      integrates with the following building management systems (BMS): BACnet
      Secure Connect, Johnson Controls Metasys, Siemens Desigo, and Delta
      Controls.
  - question: Does the energy management system offer real-time monitoring?
    answer: >-
      Yes, it provides tools for real-time monitoring and historical trend
      analysis of energy consumption.
  - question: What kind of analytics does the energy management system provide?
    answer: >-
      The energy management system tracks energy trends, identifies high
      consumption areas, generates usage reports, and links occupancy with
      energy consumption to optimize operational costs.
  - question: Is it possible to automate control of lighting and HVAC?
    answer: >-
      Yes, the energy management system allows for automation of lighting, HVAC
      (BMS), and other devices to enhance energy efficiency.
  - question: Can I set alerts for unusual energy consumption?
    answer: >-
      Yes, the energy management system allows you to set alerts for unusual
      energy consumption patterns.
  - question: What kind of insights can I gain from the energy management system?
    answer: >-
      The energy management system provides insights into energy consumption
      patterns by showcasing comparisons to occupancy and energy usage, helping
      to identify inefficiencies and optimize energy use.

# Align energy use in spaces with actual occupancy, reduce HVAC & lighting use
Use real-time occupancy data to control HVAC, lighting and technology so that you're not heating and cooling empty spaces.

## Integration - Integrate energy & occupancy
Facilitate energy and occupancy integration by connecting building systems to tenancy systems, running lighting on PoE network switches with control capabilities, and incorporating energy management workflows into existing systems.
