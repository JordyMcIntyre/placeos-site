# Align energy use in spaces with actual occupancy, reduce HVAC & lighting use
Use real-time occupancy data to control HVAC, lighting and technology so that you're not heating and cooling empty spaces.

## Integration - Integrate energy & occupancy
Facilitate energy and occupancy integration by connecting building systems to tenancy systems, running lighting on PoE network switches with control capabilities, and incorporating energy management workflows into existing systems.

## Analytics - Monitor energy trends
Track and analyze energy consumption with tools for real-time monitoring and historical trend analysis. Identify high consumption areas, generate energy usage reports, and understand the link between occupancy and energy consumption to optimize operational costs.

## Automation - Reduce energy usage
Enhance energy efficiency through automation. Control lighting, HVAC, and in-room devices remotely, set alerts for unusual energy consumption, and use occupancy or scheduling data to automate control of lighting, HVAC, and more.
