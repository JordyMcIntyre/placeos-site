## BackOffice is where operators shape the logic, integrations, and structure for every smart building deployment 

**Configuration and control for smart buildings—from one screen.**

BackOffice is the interface behind every PlaceOS deployment. It’s where integrators configure drivers, IT teams define environments, and ops teams make logic come to life.

Some people call it an admin panel. That’s true. But it’s also:

* A versioned Git gateway to your integrations
* A map-to-logic bridge for your physical environment
* A single screen for debugging multi-system workflows

If WorkMate is your workplace experience—BackOffice is the control room.

In 10 minutes, you can pull a driver from GitHub, configure a room system, and see it live on a map—no command line required.

Used across every PlaceOS deployment worldwide—hundreds of buildings, systems, and use cases.

## What you’re replacing

Before BackOffice, configuration lived in shell commands, YAML files, or scattered wikis. It looked like this:

* Logging into servers to pull driver updates
* Editing configs across dev/test/prod manually
* Losing visibility across hundreds of spaces
* Debugging failures with no centralized view

With BackOffice, all of that moves into one clean interface.

## Who it's for

BackOffice is for the people configuring the system—not just using it.

* System integrators setting up multi-vendor AV, HVAC, lighting and access
* IT and workplace teams deploying booking, visitor, or tracking apps
* Developers writing drivers or setting up automation logic
* Anyone trying to make PlaceOS do more in less time

## Why BackOffice is different

* **It’s not just settings—it’s the whole structure.**
* **It’s not tied to any one interface.**
* **It speaks Git and Crystal.**
* **It scales with you.**

You don’t outgrow BackOffice. You grow into it.

## Why BackOffice matters

The more flexible a platform is, the more complexity you need to manage.
BackOffice gives PlaceOS teams one interface to:

* Visualize system state
* Link logic to environment
* Deploy and version integrations

Now it’s all visible. It’s testable. And it’s structured.

## What BackOffice makes possible

### Think in systems, not silos

Bring all your smart building logic into one configuration tree:

* Mirror your environment with Zones (Org → Building → Level)
* Attach Systems to real rooms, floors, and functions
* Group drivers, logic, and metadata that represent how spaces behave

### Manage integrations like a product team

BackOffice lets you add, update, and roll back PlaceOS drivers and interfaces from GitHub/GitLab—no CLI needed:

* Test new branches without affecting production
* Pin drivers to specific commits
* Compile and view errors in the UI

### Add and configure drivers

Drivers are reusable modules for devices and cloud services:

* Load any driver from your connected repo
* Configure once at the driver level and reuse across systems
* View build status and recompile from the UI

### Attach logic to the physical world

Zones let you model the built environment digitally:

* Attach maps to levels (SVG)
* Bind features to spaces via metadata
* Control what users see in front-end apps via zone-level config

### Create and maintain systems

A system is a functional unit—like a meeting room or tracking setup:

* Combine drivers, logic, and metadata
* Inherit settings from parent zones
* Connect back to maps and interfaces

### Create event-driven automation

Triggers let you define behavior across your entire PlaceOS deployment:

* If no one checks into a room → release the booking
* If occupancy hits 0 → turn off HVAC
* If a driver goes offline → notify the team

### Manage users, domains and auth

Control access and surface the right experiences:

* Define OAuth providers (Azure, Google, etc.)
* Map sub-apps like Workplace or Concierge to your domains
* Grant per-domain access to specific users or groups
