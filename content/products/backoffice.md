## The challenge of a fragmented ecosystem

You're managing a sprawling network of smart devices, sensors and software. Each new integration adds another layer of complexity, another potential point of failure, and another silo of data. Your team is stretched thin, IT is a constant bottleneck and the promise of a seamless, automated environment feels just out of reach. The cost of downtime is immense, and the pressure to maintain compliance is unrelenting.

## Get time back in your day with a single platform to control and monitor all integrated technology

BackOffice is the definitive command center for your entire smart ecosystem. We empower you to move beyond fragmented controls and reactive problem-solving. Gain the strategic oversight and granular control needed to master your environment, no matter its scale or complexity.

Do simple things like monitor if a device is online, extend to powerful features like debugging device issues with the built-in console.

## Strategic advantages of a unified building command center

BackOffice isn't just another software platform; it's a fundamental shift in how you manage your portfolio of smart buildings. Move from reacting to on-site failures to executing a long-term strategy for operational excellence across your entire physical infrastructure.

### Slash on-site operational costs & IT dependency

Free your skilled IT team from configuring physical hardware. BackOffice empowers your facilities and operations staff to directly manage access control rules, lighting scenes, and AV device settings. This dramatically reduces support tickets for on-site issues and allows your technical experts to focus on strategic innovation instead of routine, in-person maintenance tasks.

### Eliminate costly building system downtime

Keep your meeting rooms, access gates, and building services running flawlessly. BackOffice provides instant diagnostics from thousands of on-site devices—from a single offline projector to a misconfigured HVAC zone. Proactively identify and resolve hardware issues remotely before they disrupt a meeting, compromise security, or impact the tenant experience.

### Simplify physical security and compliance audits

Navigate physical security and operational audits with confidence. BackOffice automatically generates an immutable, time-stamped log of every action within your buildings—who accessed a secure area, when a critical setting was changed, and by whom. This creates an ironclad audit trail for demonstrating compliance with security protocols and building regulations.

### Drive unprecedented agility in how your spaces are used

Respond to the changing needs of your occupants in minutes, not months. A centralized command center gives you the power to reconfigure how rooms work, adjust sensor-based automation, and manage device permissions on the fly. This agility allows you to optimize your physical spaces continuously for maximum efficiency and adapt quickly to new hybrid work models.

### Scale your smart building portfolio, not your complexity

Roll out sophisticated automations and standardized controls across new floors, buildings, or entire cities. BackOffice allows you to duplicate proven configurations for AV, access, and lighting from one site to another. Manage a vast, multi-site portfolio from a single pane of glass, ensuring a consistent, high-quality experience everywhere without multiplying your operational headcount.

## What BackOffice makes possible

### Think in systems, not silos

Bring all your smart building logic into one configuration tree:

* Mirror your environment with Zones (Org → Building → Level)
* Attach Systems to real rooms, floors, and functions
* Group drivers, logic, and metadata that represent how spaces behave

### Manage integrations like a product team

BackOffice lets you add, update, and roll back PlaceOS drivers and interfaces from GitHub/GitLab—no CLI needed:

* Test new branches without affecting production
* Pin drivers to specific commits
* Compile and view errors in the UI

### Add and configure drivers

Drivers are reusable modules for devices and cloud services:

* Load any driver from your connected repo
* Configure once at the driver level and reuse across systems
* View build status and recompile from the UI

### Attach logic to the physical world

Zones let you model the built environment digitally:

* Attach maps to levels (SVG)
* Bind features to spaces via metadata
* Control what users see in front-end apps via zone-level config

### Create and maintain systems

A system is a functional unit—like a meeting room or tracking setup:

* Combine drivers, logic, and metadata
* Inherit settings from parent zones
* Connect back to maps and interfaces

### Create event-driven automation

Triggers let you define behavior across your entire PlaceOS deployment:

* If no one checks into a room → release the booking
* If occupancy hits 0 → turn off HVAC
* If a driver goes offline → notify the team

### Manage users, domains and auth

Control access and surface the right experiences:

* Define OAuth providers (Azure, Google, etc.)
* Map sub-apps like Workplace or Concierge to your domains
* Grant per-domain access to specific users or groups
