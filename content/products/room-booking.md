## What is it?

PlaceOS Room Booking is an installable, self-hosted room booking system. Easily book rooms, manage availability, integrate calendars, and customize the interface. It's room booking done right. Since you host it yourself, you can customize it however you like—and you own your data completely.

## Who it's for

- **Privacy-Conscious Organizations:** Enterprises that require full control over data and on-premise solutions.
- **Coworking Spaces:** Want to reduce SaaS overhead and customize room usage policies.
- **Facilities/IT Teams:** Managing AV, occupancy, and hardware across shared spaces.
- **SMBs:** Looking for simple, predictable pricing without monthly vendor lock-in.

## But we already have a room booking tool

Sure, but most existing tools come with recurring charges that never end. You shouldn't pay tens or hundreds of dollars every month just to book rooms. Well, what if you've got 100 meeting rooms, even a moderate cost of $60 per room is $6,000 a month. That's unreasonable. Besides, many room booking tools have become overly complicated and inflexible.

## What PlaceOS Room Booking Has That Others Don’t:

- Self-hosted — data stays inside your infra
- Hardware agnostic (any tablet, any network)
- Unlimited usage model (fixed price vs. seat/room pricing)
- Rules engine for advanced room policies (e.g., time-of-day, advance booking, check-in requirements)
- Native calendar plugin (Google Workspace, Outlook)
- Automation options (auto check-in, ghost meeting detection)
## What you get
- Full ownership — no vendor lock-in
- Deploy anywhere, with any tablet or display
- One-time payment for unlimited usage
- Complete control over configuration, branding, and rules
