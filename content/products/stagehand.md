# AV control that works without third-party controllers
Stagehand is an advanced AV control platform that eliminates the need for third-party controllers so that you can manage every device directly. It also integrates with a wide range of systems—from access control to real-time location services and timetable data—so that you can identify issues and set actions to resolve those issues automatically in the future.

## Integrations extend beyond AV to the campus
We've developed hundreds of integration drivers for displays, protocols, conferencing, scheduling, directory, real-time location, access control, lighting, audio and video so that you can be confident our solution works with your technology.

## Manage AV equipment without the need for third-party controllers
Directly access and control end-point devices such as projectors, displays, and cameras from one platform.
