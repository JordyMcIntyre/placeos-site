**Stagehand gives AV and IT support teams complete remote visibility, control, and automation over every lecture hall and meeting room – so you can fix AV issues before they interrupt class – not after.** Proactively resolve problems from a web browser and eliminate disruptive onsite callouts.

## The support ticket is already too late

A frantic call from a presenter. A cryptic "it's not working" ticket. A five-minute window between classes to diagnose a problem in a room across campus. 

For AV support teams, the daily routine is reactive, stressful, and inefficient. Without visibility into each room, problems aren't caught until they're reported — and that usually means class has already been disrupted.

## Stagehand: made for campus AV support teams

When a class starts, there's no time for trial-and-error fixes. Stagehand connects directly to your AV hardware so your team can diagnose, triage, and resolve issues — without entering the room or touching a control panel.

### Use it when:

**You need to spot a failure before the lecturer does**  
Get alerts from every connected device in real time. Fix problems before they trigger a help desk ticket.

**You’re responding to a call mid-class**  
Immediately verify room status: power, source, audio levels — and guide the user without guessing.

**You’ve got 5 minutes between sessions**  
See which rooms are vacant and how long you have, so you can make changes fast and remotely.

---
## Most tools solve a slice of the problem

- **Remote desktop software?** Not AV-specific, clunky for multi-device control, and often blocked by security policies.  
- **Control systems?** Require programming expertise and costly hardware upgrades.  
- **Manual walk-ins?** Disruptive, inefficient and can’t scale across large campuses.  
- **Monitoring dashboards?** Show alerts, but don’t give control or context.
