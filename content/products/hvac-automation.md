## Automate HVAC usage based on actual presence

Rather than heating or cooling based on fixed schedules, PlaceOS adjusts HVAC output in real time based on whether spaces are occupied. This means no more conditioning empty rooms—and no more manual overrides.

## No sensors. No hardware. No problem.

Unlike other solutions that require physical occupancy sensors, PlaceOS uses existing IT systems—like Wi-Fi networks and booking platforms—to infer occupancy. That means faster deployment, lower cost, and no disruption to your building.


## Make your existing BMS smarter

Already have a Building Management System? PlaceOS integrates directly to extend its capabilities. Create automation rules based on booking data, occupancy signals, and business hours—without replacing existing infrastructure.

## Control ventilation based on demand

PlaceOS supports demand control ventilation by using live occupancy signals to modulate airflow intelligently. Keep air quality high when rooms are full—and reduce fan load when they’re empty.

## Overlay occupancy and energy data for better insights

See exactly how occupancy aligns with energy usage. With PlaceOS, you can monitor consumption across zones, flag anomalies, and identify opportunities to improve building efficiency—without guessing.

## Control more than just HVAC

While HVAC is the core use case, PlaceOS can also automate lighting, AV, and in-room tech. Set conditions for entire rooms, floors, or zones—all in one web-based interface.

## Build rules that match how your building runs

Trigger HVAC start-up based on the first booking of the day. Shut off lights when everyone leaves. Tailor automation to your business logic, without writing code.

## Analyze energy patterns over time

Track usage across days, weeks, and seasons. Use PlaceOS analytics tools to build energy profiles, evaluate occupancy trends, and justify operational decisions.

## Cut costs without the capital project

PlaceOS offers building-wide HVAC automation that doesn’t require a construction crew. Start optimizing immediately—with what you already have.
