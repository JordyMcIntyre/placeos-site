faqs:    
- question: What is occupancy monitoring?  
  answer: >-  
    Occupancy monitoring is the process of tracking how spaces are used, how many people are present, and when. It enables better use of space, energy, and services.
    
- question: What is an occupancy monitoring system?  
  answer: >-  
    An occupancy monitoring system combines data from existing building infrastructure — like Wi-Fi, badge access, lighting, and HVAC — to determine where people are in real time.
    
- question: How do you measure room occupancy?  
  answer: >-  
    Room occupancy can be measured using a combination of data sources, including Wi-Fi access points, badge swipes, motion sensors, and cameras.
    
- question: Are occupancy sensors worth it?  
  answer: >-  
    Only in select areas. We avoid full-scale sensor rollouts and instead use infrastructure you already have. Sensors are supported, but optional.
    
- question: Can a smart thermostat detect room occupancy?  
  answer: >-  
    Some smart thermostats have motion detection. But for enterprise-grade monitoring, you’ll want to combine signals from HVAC, Wi-Fi, and booking data.
    
- question: What are the three types of occupant detection system sensors?  
  answer: >-  
    Common types include passive infrared (PIR), ultrasonic, and camera-based sensors. PlaceOS integrates with all — but doesn't require them.
    
- question: What happens during an occupancy check?  
  answer: >-  
    In smart buildings, occupancy checks happen automatically. PlaceOS continuously evaluates presence data across systems.
    
- question: Do we need to buy new sensors?  
  answer: >-  
    No. That’s the point. PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring works with your existing infrastructure — Wi-Fi, HVAC, badge access, and more.

# A self-hosted occupancy monitoring system that works with the infrastructure you already have — no new sensors needed.

Works with the infrastructure you already have to give you real-time visibility into space usage. You own the system. You own the data.

Most platforms force you to buy their sensors. We don’t. PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring turns what you already have into real-time intelligence about how your space is being used.

## What is it?

PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring is a self-hosted, installable system that collects and layers multiple building signals to generate accurate, real-time occupancy insights. No new devices required. You own the system and the data.

## Who it’s for

- **Space Planners**: Model demand by actual use — not headcount 
- **Facilities Managers**: Match services like HVAC and cleaning to actual presence 
- **Workplace Teams**: Enhance room booking with live occupancy monitoring   
- **IT/AV Teams**: Monitor usage trends, automate infrastructure based on presence
    

## But we already track occupancy

Sort of. Many teams rely on partial signals — like badge data or Wi-Fi logs. Others use siloed sensor networks. But none of that gives a holistic view. PlaceOS layers multiple inputs for better coverage and higher confidence.

## What PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring Has That Others Don’t:

- No vendor lock-in — works with your existing infrastructure
- Signal layering for better truth
- Rules engine to support occupancy-driven automation
- Edge-processing options for privacy
- Modular by region, building, or floor
    

## What you get

- Own the software and the data
    
- Deploy anywhere — works with existing networks and sensors
    
- One-time pricing
    
- Enterprise-ready integrations
    

## Signals We Use

### Wi-Fi

Detects presence near access points. Good for zone-level estimates and dwell time.

### Lighting & HVAC Sensors

Motion and presence sensors already in building systems.

### Access Control

Badge swipes and mobile entries. Great for headcount and traffic flow.

### Cameras

Conference or security cameras with people-counting or CV-based detection.

### Desk Sensors (Optional)

Granular desk-level presence. Use selectively where needed.

## Why We Don't Require Sensor Rollouts

Most “occupancy monitoring systems” require expensive, building-wide sensor deployments. That’s slow, costly, and invasive.

PlaceOS does it differently. We connect to what’s already in your building — networks, lighting, HVAC, access control, and cameras — to build a unified picture. Sensors can be added for granularity, but they’re never required.

## Layered Data = Higher Confidence

|Input|Strength|Limitation|
|---|---|---|
|Wi-Fi|Broad coverage|Doesn’t see unconnected devices|
|Badge|Confirmed entry|No in-space visibility|
|HVAC/Light|Passive presence|Room-level only|
|Camera|High fidelity|Privacy, placement, cost|
|Desk Sensor|Desk-level accuracy|Hardware required|

## Automation Examples

> These are examples of what customers can build once PlaceOS is deployed. Automation rules are created by your team based on your building's context.

### Meeting Room Release

Booking + camera tripwire = cancel ghost meetings

### Energy Optimization

Booked + no motion = don’t trigger HVAC
