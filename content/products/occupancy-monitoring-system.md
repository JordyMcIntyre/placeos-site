Works with the infrastructure you already have to give you real-time visibility into space usage. You own the system. You own the data.

Most platforms force you to buy their sensors. We don’t. PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring turns what you already have into real-time intelligence about how your space is being used.

## What is it?

PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring is a self-hosted, installable system that collects and layers multiple building signals to generate accurate, real-time occupancy insights. No new devices required. You own the system and the data.

## Who it’s for

- **Space Planners**: Model demand by actual use — not headcount 
- **Facilities Managers**: Match services like HVAC and cleaning to actual presence 
- **Workplace Teams**: Enhance room booking with live occupancy monitoring   
- **IT/AV Teams**: Monitor usage trends, automate infrastructure based on presence
    

## But we already track occupancy

Sort of. Many teams rely on partial signals — like badge data or Wi-Fi logs. Others use siloed sensor networks. But none of that gives a holistic view. PlaceOS layers multiple inputs for better coverage and higher confidence.

## What PlaceOS Occupancy Monitoring Has That Others Don’t:

- No vendor lock-in — works with your existing infrastructure
- Signal layering for better truth
- Rules engine to support occupancy-driven automation
- Edge-processing options for privacy
- Modular by region, building, or floor
    

## What you get

- Own the software and the data
    
- Deploy anywhere — works with existing networks and sensors
    
- One-time pricing
    
- Enterprise-ready integrations
    

## Signals We Use

### Wi-Fi

Detects presence near access points. Good for zone-level estimates and dwell time.

### Lighting & HVAC Sensors

Motion and presence sensors already in building systems.

### Access Control

Badge swipes and mobile entries. Great for headcount and traffic flow.

### Cameras

Conference or security cameras with people-counting or CV-based detection.

### Desk Sensors (Optional)

Granular desk-level presence. Use selectively where needed.

## Why We Don't Require Sensor Rollouts

Most “occupancy monitoring systems” require expensive, building-wide sensor deployments. That’s slow, costly, and invasive.

PlaceOS does it differently. We connect to what’s already in your building — networks, lighting, HVAC, access control, and cameras — to build a unified picture. Sensors can be added for granularity, but they’re never required.

## Layered Data = Higher Confidence

|Input|Strength|Limitation|
|---|---|---|
|Wi-Fi|Broad coverage|Doesn’t see unconnected devices|
|Badge|Confirmed entry|No in-space visibility|
|HVAC/Light|Passive presence|Room-level only|
|Camera|High fidelity|Privacy, placement, cost|
|Desk Sensor|Desk-level accuracy|Hardware required|

## Automation Examples

> These are examples of what customers can build once PlaceOS is deployed. Automation rules are created by your team based on your building's context.

### Meeting Room Release

Booking + camera tripwire = cancel ghost meetings

### Energy Optimization

Booked + no motion = don’t trigger HVAC

## Built for Your Building

- Modular per building or floor 
- Plug into any calendar or building system
- Edge processing where needed
