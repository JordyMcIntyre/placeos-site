### 2. Access Your Profile
- Tap the **profile icon** in the top-right corner.

- Tap **Request Virtual Card**.

### 3. Check Your Email
- You’ll receive an activation email from HID Origo.
- You have two options:
  - **Option A:** Enter the invitation code manually in the app.
  - **Option B:** Open the invitation link directly on your phone.

### 4. Confirm Card Activation

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- HID Mobile Access **only works in buildings that have been configured by PlaceOS**.
- If you do not see the “Staff ID” option or the “Request Virtual Card” button, your building is likely not yet supported.
