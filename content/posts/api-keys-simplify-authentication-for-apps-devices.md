An easy way to communicate without the need to authenticate first. This simplifies the process of building third-party apps and server-to-server interactions.

The API Keys can be used for unattended panel access, accessing the PlaceOS API, and using the real-time websocket. Whatâ€™s that translate to? PlaceOS requires all interactions to be authenticated and associated with a specific identity. This includes fixed devices such as visitor sign-in kiosks or public information displays. This allows for auto-login across those devices.

Tokens can be revoked or expired to prevent ongoing access without having to share passwords.  
  
Simple, effective, secure.  
  
You can find API Keys under the Admin Panel in the latest version of Backoffice.
