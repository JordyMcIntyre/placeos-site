Optimizing Building Energy Efficiency with Automation and Contextual Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you tired of paying exorbitant energy bills for your office building? Do you want to reduce your carbon footprint and make your office more sustainable? As a building manager, I know how challenging it can be to maintain a comfortable and energy-efficient workspace. However, with the help of automation and contextual data, it is possible to optimize building energy efficiency and reduce energy costs.

### HVAC Systems and Lighting: Common Culprits of Energy Waste

One of the most common problems that building managers face is HVAC systems running unnecessarily, heating or cooling empty spaces. This can result in a significant waste of energy and an increase in energy bills. Similarly, leaving lights on when not needed can also add to the energy bill.

Fortunately, these are simple scenarios that are more common than they should be, and they offer excellent opportunities for automation. By leveraging contextual data, we can trigger actions that improve building efficiency and reduce energy waste.

### Improving Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

By dynamically triggering the HVAC system based on real-time occupancy data. PlaceOS is able to reduce HVAC run-time by three hours per day, resulting in a 23% reduction in energy usage. This simple workflow saved $250,000 in indirect energy savings and helped reduce the carbon footprint by 5000 tons of CO2.

The key to this success was the availability of contextual data that allowed the identification of inefficiencies and triggering of actions to address them.

### Embrace Automation for a Sustainable Future

This is just one example of how automation and contextual data can help building managers reduce energy costs and improve sustainability. There are many more workflows that can be implemented to further optimize building efficiency and reduce energy waste.

By embracing automation and leveraging contextual data, building managers can take the first steps towards reducing energy costs, making their buildings more sustainable, and contributing to a greener future.
