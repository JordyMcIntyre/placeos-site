When it comes to marketing campaigns and sales funnels, there’s a pretty well-defined approach. To keep things simple let’s say you’re driving traffic to a website then analyzing user engagement and making decisions based on that information to deliver a more successful campaign.

The information we receive from people engaging with the website provides context; who, where, and when. This is what guides our decisions when aiming to make improvements.

We can use this same methodology and apply it to UX design for enterprise workplaces, residential, education, healthcare, or any industry vertical.

### So how would it work? 

Who, where, and when, without that, we can’t identify any pain points that need to be addressed.

This is akin to the user journey for a digital marketing campaign. Men between the ages of 45-54 are buying more of Brand A’s Running Shoe on Tuesdays, let’s make some change to capitalize on that trend. 

OR

Users are exiting the sales funnel because the form is too cumbersome and they’re dropping off midway through. Minimize the number of required fields and monitor whether or not the form completion rate increases.

### **Why is this beneficial?**

The reason this approach can be applied to UX design is the simplicity. Lots of people who wouldn't consider themselves data people probably have a really good handle on marketing analytics and conversion optimization. 

At the end of the day, even if we're not selling someone something, if the organization's goal is wanting people to volunteer to start earlier in the day so that they can manage utilization across the day. One of your conversions can be someone starting earlier in the day. And then you can look at the attributing factors to whether or not someone converts. It doesn't matter that they're not buying shoes, we can still utilize all of this research that has existed and been optimized over such a long time and apply it to a different concept.

### **What to look out for.** 

Context is key. We're trying to use digital technology and integrations to get the most context so we can trigger things automatically and rather than triggering things to sell, we're triggering things to improve the user experience. If there’s no context you could fall risk of making decisions based on inclinations, not data.

> To be able to communicate that data effectively, you need context. 

Let’s say desk utilization in a building is up 30% year on year, the best thing that can happen is someone will ask you why. Unless you've got anything context-wise to back that up, you can’t really speak to that data set or make any rational decisions because the best outcome has happened and you've got nothing to back it up with. Look at what either correlation or causation is happening and then at what you can actually do to move on because the why and the how is what ends up making a decision later on.
