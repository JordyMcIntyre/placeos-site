In response to the seismic shifts in work dynamics, many companies are grappling with the decision to downsize their office spaces. The appeal of reducing overhead costs can be tempting, but this decision, often made hastily, conceals a multitude of potential issues.

Imagine the initial euphoria of reducing your office footprint, only to be hit with the chilling realization that this move is having unforeseen negative impacts.

*   Your office environment becomes less inviting.
*   Collaboration suffers.
*   Employee morale takes a nosedive.

You see a domino effect in action.

Fewer people coming in results in a need for further downsizing, trapping you in an endless, detrimental cycle. And then, there's the notion of mandated returns.

Mandating employees to return to the office may seem like an easy fix, but it can exacerbate the problem. It can create a sense of resentment and discomfort among your employees, making your office a place they have to be rather than a place they want to be. This is a far cry from the vibrant, engaging workplace you envision.

Fortunately, these hazards can be navigated with foresight, careful planning, and strategic use of technology. Here are the crucial steps:

### **1\. Understand Why Employees Aren't Coming In**

Before taking any drastic measures, determine the reasons for your office space underutilization. Is it purely due to the increase in remote work, or are other factors involved? And then is there anything you can change?

### **2\. Engage with ALL Stakeholders**

Establish open lines of communication with your staff, management, and executive teams. Their insights and perspectives can be incredibly valuable in formulating a plan that addresses everyone's needs. [Lisa Munao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-munao-368415233/) highlighted this perfectly in her guest appearance on our [Workplace Insights Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8aWtgPN0o0&list=PLkWMNcFwKxR24xNwOnVJqx1LHBK92ZvUe).

### **3\. Consider Workplace Design**

The design of your workspace plays a crucial role in its utilization. Instead of downsizing, consider whether a workspace redesign could enhance productivity and collaboration.

### **4\. Anticipate the Domino Effect**

Take into account the potential cascading effect of downsizing. Will reducing your office space make the environment less inviting, prompting even fewer people to come in?

**5\. Explore Repurposing Your Space**

Consider options for repurposing your office space before downsizing. You could sublet unused areas or create multipurpose spaces for a range of activities.
