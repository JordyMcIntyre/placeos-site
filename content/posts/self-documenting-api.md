Our [APIs](https://docs.placeos.com/reference/api) are now self documenting, generating highly accurate [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) docs. The advantage of which is being able to generate client libraries for any programming language without writing code.

This means any one of our partners or clients can interact with PlaceOS in their preferred programming language. This update increases the ease of interaction.
