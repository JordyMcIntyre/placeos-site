### Experience Surveys

Experience Surveys can be enabled as part of PlaceOS ONE or our Enterprise Workplace Solutions. This feature allows organizations to gather insights into how users are engaging with their spaces, adding important context to any other types of utilization data that can be collected using PlaceOS.

### Work from Home Status

See who’s going to be in the office and when. This will also feed into room booking experience, for example, if someone is marked as working from home and booked into a meeting, this information will be factored in when catering for room size. Note the icons next to the confirmed attendees dictating their location for the upcoming meeting.
