Mario, our energy expert, will be doing a deep dive into Energy Analytics. He'll explain the technical details behind our analytics tools, where the data comes from and demonstrate how it can help you understand energy in your building. You'll get insights into energy usage patterns and areas for improvement, and learn about the technical decisions that go into optimizing energy usage in commercial real estate.
