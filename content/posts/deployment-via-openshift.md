[OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a Kubernetes distribution and management framework developed and maintained by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en). OpenShift is platform agnostic and available across a range of cloud providers. While the PlaceOS Platform uses Kubernetes as its primary deployment and distribution platform, we are extending this to include OpenShift Support in conjunction with growing demand from current clients.

OpenShift is a commercially licensed product that is distributed and managed by Red Hat while Kubernetes is a free and open-source platform developed by Google. As OpenShift is a commercial platform, organizations have access to support and regular updates under license agreements with Red Hat. More on that [here](https://www.openshift.com/blog/enterprise-kubernetes-with-openshift-part-one).
