Energy is a top priority for countries, organizations and people around the globe. Outside of improving the energy source, reducing energy consumption is the most immediate way to make an impact.

Real estate being the largest asset class on Earth, it’s also the largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, responsible for 40% of global energy use, global CO2 emissions, and 40% of raw material consumption. 

Building floor area is expected to double by 2060, adding 2.4 trillion ft2 (230 billion m2) of new floor area to the global building stock. The equivalent of adding an entire New York City to the world, every month, for 40 years. Of the emissions, approximately 70% are produced by building operations, while the remaining 30% comes from construction. It’s this 70% being produced by building operations where PropTech can play a role in reducing its carbon footprint.

There’s also new mandates being introduced which look at punitive measures for poor performing buildings. [Local Law 97](/industry/energy) in New York which will fine building owners and in the UK, [building owners won’t be able to lease their building unless they improve their energy rating](https://www.placeos.com/blog/ps93bn-of-commercial-real-estate-is-at-risk-heres-what-to-do).

So how do we reduce energy consumption in commercial real estate?

First you need to collect [energy data](/blog/the-importance-of-energy-data) and then take action. In this article I’m going to break down how we collect the data, then use that to automate the systems which improves energy efficiency.

Sources of Energy Data & Consumption
------------------------------------

### Building Management Systems in Energy Data Collection

PlaceOS integrates with Building Management Systems (BMS), this gives us access to real-time data on energy consumption, HVAC performance, lighting levels, and more. This integration enables a comprehensive aggregation and analysis of energy usage from various sources within a building. More importantly, it allows us control over the system. More on that shortly.

It’s worth noting that [HVAC systems are the biggest source of energy consumption](https://youtu.be/EXSFGL_Ubd8) in the building. So improvements to the HVAC operational efficiency will have the biggest impact.

#### BMS Integrations

*   BACnet Secure Connect
*   Johnson Controls Metasys
*   Siemens Desigo
*   Delta Controls

### Lighting

Lighting is also big contributor to energy consumption, not quite as big as HVAC, but still considerable enough to warrant serious consideration when looking to improve energy consumption. We can connect with lighting systems to monitor and automate for improved efficiency. 

#### Lighting Integrations

*   Leviton
*   KNX
*   C-Bus
*   DynaLite
*   Lutron
*   DALI
*   Helvar

### Energy Bills

If your building doesn’t have access to any of the above. You’re still able to take your energy bill and use that as the benchmark. If number goes down, then good. Don’t worry, you’ll still be able to optimize your building to improve energy consumption. 

Which brings me to the next part, occupancy.

Occupancy Integrations
----------------------

We collect and use occupancy data as a condition which triggers actions like turning off lights or the HVAC system. This is the secret sauce really. We collect occupancy data through Directory Services, Sensors, Cameras and Bookings. Either by themselves or a combination, it depends on the setting. Here’s our list of integrations that can provide some form of occupancy data.

### Directory Services

*   Azure AD (via MS Graph API)
*   Hybrid on-premise Active Directory (via MS Graph API)
*   Google Workspace (GSuite)

### Resource Booking

*   Microsoft 365
*   Google Workspace (GSuite)
*   Native PlaceOS resource booking

### Real Time Location

*   Cisco Spaces
*   Cisco Meraki RTLS
*   Cisco CMX
*   HP Aruba ALE
*   (Juniper) Mist
*   Kontakt.io

### Sensors

*   Vergesense
*   Floorsense
*   XY Sense
*   Xovis
*   Steinel
*   CMS Engage
*   SenseStudio
*   Kaiterra
*   GoBright
*   FreeSpace
*   Meraki MV

Utilizing Energy Data for Optimization
--------------------------------------

With the rich data collected, PlaceOS offers data-driven insights to identify inefficiencies and areas where energy is being wasted. The easiest example to visualize is [energy versus occupancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlQZu7i7QRM). If a room has high energy use and low occupancy, this indicates a potential area for improvement or that something technical has gone wrong in that room. 

### Occupancy-Based Energy Optimization

PlaceOS can automate building systems' operations, leveraging real-time data and predefined rules to enhance energy efficiency. Adjustments to lighting, HVAC systems, and equipment ensure that energy is **not wasted on heating, cooling, or lighting unoccupied areas**, leading to substantial energy savings.

[Here’s an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCmouaE5jNk).
