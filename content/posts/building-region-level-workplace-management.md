Managing multiple buildings shouldn’t be a hassle. The right system gives you **control, flexibility** and **standardization**—at scale.

Here’s how WorkMate does it:  

1\. Region-Level Settings (Global/Country Controls)
---------------------------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Define core policies that apply to all buildings in a region (e.g., Continents, countries or states).
*   **Use Case:** A company sets **standardized room booking rules** across all locations but allows individual buildings to override them.

**Why it matters:** Ensures consistency across multiple sites while allowing flexibility for local needs.

2\. Building-Level Settings
---------------------------

*   **Feature:** Every building inherits region settings but can override them as needed.
*   **Use Case:** The HQ might have **exclusive executive meeting rooms**, while smaller offices allow open bookings.

**Why it matters:** Standardization where it makes sense, customization where it’s necessary.

3\. Time Zone & Location Control
--------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Assign correct time zones and locations to each building.
*   **Use Case:** A company with offices in **Sydney and London** ensures scheduling and automation work across different time zones.

**Why it matters:** Avoids scheduling conflicts and ensures automation runs at the right time.

4\. Workplace Features (Rooms, Desks, Parking, Visitors, Support)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Enable or disable workplace services per building.
*   **Use Case:** **Hot desking** is enabled at regional hubs, while **assigned seating** is used in smaller offices.

**Why it matters:** Different buildings serve different functions—settings should reflect that.

5\. Room & Desk Management
--------------------------

*   **Feature:** Configure booking settings for rooms and desks at the building level.
*   **Use Case:** A **corporate HQ allows multi-day desk bookings**, while a coworking space only permits same-day reservations.

**Why it matters:** Prevents a one-size-fits-all approach to workspace management.

6\. Auto-Release & No-Show Cancellation
---------------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Free up meeting rooms and desks if no one shows up.
*   **Use Case:** If a **meeting room is empty for 10 minutes**, it’s automatically released for others to book.

**Why it matters:** Stops wasted space and improves room utilization, can apply this globally or at the building d

7\. Parking Management
----------------------

*   **Feature:** Set parking rules per building, including reserved spots or booking requirements.
*   **Use Case:** A **downtown office requires reservations**, while a suburban campus offers open parking.

**Why it matters:** Prevents congestion in high-demand locations.

8\. Concierge & Facility Management
-----------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Toggle concierge services like front desk support, event assistance, or maintenance requests.
*   **Use Case:** A **large HQ may need front desk check-ins**, but smaller offices can operate without them.

**Why it matters:** Supports different operational models across sites.

9\. Calendar Event & Booking Rules
----------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Define how events and meetings are scheduled per building.
*   **Use Case:** **Leadership floors** may only allow executive assistants to book rooms, while general employees can book elsewhere.

**Why it matters:** Prioritizes space for the right people at the right times.

10\. Auto-Release Notifications & Alerts
----------------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Send reminders for upcoming bookings and release unconfirmed reservations.
*   **Use Case:** If a **user forgets about a booking**, they get a notification before it’s automatically canceled.

**Why it matters:** Reduces no-shows and improves booking efficiency.

11\. Induction & Access for Visitors & Contractors
--------------------------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Require safety or security inductions before granting access.
*   **Use Case:** Contractors must **complete a safety induction** before being allowed entry.

**Why it matters:** Ensures compliance and security without manual intervention.

12\. Support & Maintenance Requests
-----------------------------------

*   **Feature:** Allow users to log IT, AV or facility issues specific to each building.
*   **Use Case:** Employees can **report faulty projectors** in a meeting room or request additional desks in high-traffic spaces.

**Why it matters:** Speeds up issue resolution and keeps spaces functional.
