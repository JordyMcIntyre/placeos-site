title: PlaceOS
description: >-
  A modular integration platform for building automation and experience —
  without replacing your existing tech stack.
list_items:
  - title: >-
      For people managing space using complex building systems and technology
      stacks
    summary: >-
      The ones holding it all together. IT teams, space planners, experience
      leads, facilities, AV and IoT managers — anyone managing complexity across
      buildings, systems, and tech stacks. We help you stitch it all together
      and make it work.
  - title: You don’t need another sensor, dashboard or single pane of glass
    summary: >-
      You already invested in technology — get more out of it. You’ve got
      sensors, booking tools, AV systems, dashboards. But they don’t talk to
      each other. If AV doesn’t trigger climate, or your calendar doesn’t talk
      to access control, it’s not about needing new tech. It’s about putting the
      pieces in sync. Let’s stop paying more for more noise.
  - title: A true platform – like wordpress but for buildings
    summary: >-
      Open, agnostic, and built for extensibility. Like WordPress or Salesforce,
      you can build solutions on top, plug in components, or buy something off
      the shelf (more on that below). You don’t buy a fixed app. You get a
      foundation. Build your own workflows, or start with one of ours. Platforms
      let others build — that’s the difference.
  - title: What's not a platform
    summary: >
      Hardcoded apps pretending to be flexible. The term \"platform\" gets
      thrown around a lot. But most of the time, it doesn’t mean what it should.
      A true platform separates logic from the interface. It has modular
      integrations, open APIs, and allows others to build on top. The interface
      can be anything — but the smarts, logic, and automation all live in the
      backend. 


      Vendors often call their single-use apps “platforms.” A room booking app
      where everything is hardcoded? Not a platform. A dashboard that only
      connects to its own ecosystem? Still not a platform. If you can’t build on
      it or extend it without asking permission or signing an NDA — it’s not a
      platform. Salesforce is a platform. WordPress is a platform. You can build
      on them, resell your version, or plug in your own tools. That’s what
      PlaceOS is too. A platform isn’t just about where it runs — it’s about
      what it enables. If it locks you in, it’s not a platform. Hardcoded apps.
      Fixed dashboards. Tools that only work with their own ecosystem. That’s
      not a platform — that’s vendor lock-in.
  - title: Why architecture matters
    summary: >-
      An abstraction layer with hot-swappable modules. PlaceOS creates an
      abstraction layer between your integrations and your logic — so you can
      swap tech in and out without breaking anything. Drivers handle the
      connection, modules group them, and logic stays untouched. That’s what
      makes it scalable and future-ready.
  - title: We've built hundreds of drivers
    summary: >-
      Every integration starts here — and we support hundreds. Drivers connect
      PlaceOS to your systems — like access control, AV, HVAC, sensors, or
      calendars. They’re open source. Build your own or use what’s already in
      the library. See our integration list here.
  - title: Hot-swappable modules
    summary: >-
      We bundle drivers into modules. Modules are reusable components that make
      logic portable. You can swap out tech behind the scenes — everything keeps
      working.
  - title: Scaling with zones & systems
    summary: >-
      Scale with consistency — and tweak as needed. Zones let you apply logic
      across similar spaces — like all meeting rooms, or all teaching spaces.
      Systems group your integrations so they’re easy to replicate. It’s how we
      go from one room to an entire building — or from one building to a global
      rollout — without starting over. And you can still tweak individual spaces
      without affecting global settings.
  - title: Workflow automation with triggers & logic drivers
    summary: >-
      Automations you can run on day one — or scale to complex logic. This is
      where the automation lives. Triggers connect inputs to actions — no manual
      steps, no waiting on the user. On day one, you can automate HVAC based on
      room bookings. Or set up AV to power on when someone walks in. No app
      needed. And if you need more complexity, Logic Drivers give you full
      control for layered conditions and decision-making.
  - title: Decoupled frontend interface & experience from integrations & logic
    summary: >-
      Supports varying systems across sites — with consistent logic. AV panel,
      app, AI agent — it doesn’t matter. PlaceOS handles the backend. Run
      workflows with or without a user interface. Different systems in different
      buildings? Still works the same.
  - title: What you can do with PlaceOS
    summary: >
      Automation that actually delivers outcomes.


      - Automate HVAC based on real-time occupancy and room bookings — save ~$1K
      per room per year


      - Swipe your badge and trigger camera footage to log the moment — find
      what you need, instantly


      - Auto-configure a room based on who booked it — lighting, presets, even
      signage


      - Use WorkMate for out-of-the-box workplace management — bookings,
      presence, mobile-first UX


      - Use Stagehand to simplify AV control for any room — touch panel, web,
      voice, or automated


      - Use VirtualCare to manage remote check-ins and hybrid support in
      healthcare or campuses


      Everything you do can become a trigger. Every system can be part of a
      workflow.
  - title: Why other tools don't cut it
    summary: |
      - Custom middleware: Slow, brittle, expensive to maintain

      - Vendor-locked apps: Can’t extend or integrate

      - Dashboards only: Good for viewing, not doing

      - Doing nothing: Keeps everything disconnected

      - SaaS-only tools: Hardcoded logic, no flexibility
  - title: Why PlaceOS is different
    summary: >
      The structural choices that set us apart — and why they matter.


      - Composable architecture: Swap parts without breaking workflows


      - Open source drivers: No vendor lock-in, fast integration


      - Separation of logic/interface: Survives tech churn


      - UI-agnostic: Works with LLMs, CV, APIs — or no UI at all


      - Platform-based business model: SaaS, usage-based, or license-ready


      - AI-agent ready: Agents can control any system via drivers


      All of this means you can build, scale, and adapt — without ever being
      boxed in.
  - title: You can start anywhere, as small as you like
    summary: >-
      Start small. Prove value. Scale fast. You don’t need a huge rollout. Start
      with one workflow — like automating HVAC or linking AV to your calendar —
      and grow from there. Proof in week one, not year two. Sometimes scaling a
      small change can have a massive impact. See our energy savings on campus —
      ~$1K per room per year. We’re not asking for a forklift upgrade. Start
      with what you’ve got. We’ll make it work harder.
  - title: Apps suck (but yeah, we’ve got some)
    summary: >
      We’ve built apps like WorkMate that are ready to go. An app solves the obvious stuff, bundling up common problems in one place. Tapping into your phone’s native tech like Bluetooth, NFC, and Ultra-Wideband for access and location.

      But that’s just the surface. We go beyond with deep integrations, smart workflows, and modular interfaces.

      Our apps sit on top of the platform architecture so receive all the same benefits of hot-swappable modules and logic. When the next interface drops, glasses, wearables, or whatever OpenAI’s cooking, we’ll be there. Because we’ve decoupled the front-end from the brains, making the experience future-proof, flexible and device-agnostic.

      Here are our apps:

      **WorkMate**: The first workplace management system to combine
      out-of-the-box simplicity with enterprise-level configuration &
      scalability.


      **StageHand**: Remote AV control that works without third-party
      controllers.


      **VirtualCare**: Gives clinicians, carers, and patients one system to
      manage consults, surveys, referrals, Medicare billing, education, and
      follow-ups — no plugins or patchwork tools.


      **Room booking** (Free): Search, view, and book rooms based on
      availability, size, features, and location.


      **Room booking** (Basic): Works with every calendar tool, conferencing
      system, occupancy sensor, AV equipment and network.


      **Desk booking**: Configurable desk booking management at scale — no
      hardware lock-in.


      **Visitor management**: So simple, the only thing you do is send the
      invite — it does everything else.


      **Occupancy-based energy**: Align energy use in spaces with actual
      occupancy to reduce HVAC & lighting use.
  - title: We’ve got an experienced tech team who can build our own stuff
    summary: >-
      We’d love that. Honestly, it’s a better move than getting locked into some rigid, hard-coded app. But we think we can give you the best of both worlds: a head start that lets you focus on your unique challenges without getting buried in device-level protocol hell.

      Our integration drivers don’t just connect you to hundreds of vendors, we also support the protocols that make smart buildings actually smart: BACnet, Modbus, KNX, and more. We handle the heavy lifting, device integrations, zone management, system coordination, so you can get straight to building.

      Now your scoping exercise changes: What do you want to build, knowing you can connect everything you need?

      Take it from there. Extend with new drivers. Contribute to our open source libraries. Talk to us about using a non-commercial version for that side project you’ve been meaning to automate.
      
      We’re built for developers.

  - title: Pricing models that suit your business
    summary: >-
      SaaS, usage-based, or perpetual — we support it all. We don’t care how you
      buy — just that it fits. SaaS, usage-based, annual license, perpetual —
      OPEX or CAPEX, your call. We’ve seen every procurement process under the
      sun. We’ll work with yours.
  - title: Flexible delivery – cloud, on-prem & hybrid
    summary: >-
      It's your call, run PlaceOS wherever it makes sense. If you've got high
      security standards, everything can run on-prem ensuring your data remains
      protected. We don't store anything.
  - title: Plugs into what you've already got
    summary: >-
      This replaces nothing — unless you want it to. PlaceOS doesn’t require you
      to rip and replace. It plugs into what you’ve already got. Integrate first
      — replace later, if needed.
  - title: Future proof by design
    summary: >-
      Built for what’s next — not just what’s now. PlaceOS isn’t tied to any one
      interface, vendor, or trend. As tech shifts — LLMs, AI agents, new
      protocols — we’re already wired for it. We didn’t build PlaceOS to be
      finished. We built it to keep going. That’s the difference between a
      product and a platform.
