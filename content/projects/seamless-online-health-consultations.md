## Project Overview

Historically, clinicians across NSW have used multiple platforms and solutions to conduct virtual consultations. There hasn’t been a consistent, fit-for-purpose state-wide approach, and there has been confusion among staff about which service to use.

Previously, clinicians have mostly conducted consultations via telephone to complement in-person appointments. This is due to the lack of system integration, limited staff training, and varying access and user experiences with videoconferencing.

## Features

{{< wistia id="eew9636mwt" >}}

myVirtualCare provides patients with a seamless and convenient way to access their clinical and social care providers using one web link on any internet-enabled device.

Since the development and release of myVirtualCare there has been a significant increase in use of the platform. Clinicians, patients, their families and carers are now experiencing the many benefits of virtual care, especially during COVID-19 lockdowns.

myVirtualCare is supporting patients to access a variety of services including cancer care, palliative care, nutrition and dietetics, pain, mental health, chronic and complex care, and speech and rehabilitation services.

## Outcomes

*   Improved workflows across the board with customized intuitive interfaces, new virtual waiting rooms, and automations that integrated with the existing technology stack and opened up the ability to connect more services on top.
*   Resolved Medicare Bulk-Billing and clinicians’ consultation fees through automated and improved workflows.
*   Integrations with existing active directory to provide SSO for clinicians.
*   Added SMS integration to notify clinicians for key events like when a patient enters the waiting room and is ready for the consultation.
*   Extended conferencing capabilities by building workflows that easily allowed patients and clinicians to dial in specialists, translators, and guests like family members or carers.
*   The platform provided the tools to generate custom detailed reports on many important metrics; number of patients per clinician type, consulting room data, etc.
