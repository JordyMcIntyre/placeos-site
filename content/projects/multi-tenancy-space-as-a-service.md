## Project Overview
This Government Agency required a multifunctional and scalable workspace management system to serve various federal agencies. It must accurately authenticate users to manage and charge for space utilization, and provide a scalable model suitable for other government spaces facing underutilization.

--------

## Features
### PlaceOS Platform Integration 
Leveraging cloud-hosted PlaceOS on Azure for robust connectivity with essential data sources and systems. The setup includes branding, an interactive floorplan, and multiple user access points (employee/member app, concierge app, kiosk app).

### Authentication & User Account Management 
Utilizes Azure B2C for streamlined single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, allowing users to create accounts using government-approved email domains.

### Advanced Resource Booking & Management
Room & Desk Booking interfaces for users. Concierge Interface for room & desk management. Room Configuration & Rule Sets.

### Visitor Management and Real-Time Location Services (RTLS)
Minimal visitor management due to security constraints and advanced RTLS for finding colleagues within the facility.

### Authenticated WiFi Access and Feedback Systems
Implements WiFi access linked to room/desk reservations and automated survey distribution post-use to gather user feedback.

### Space Utilization
Desk & room utilization data broken down by agency.

## Outcomes
### Reservations
Our data reveals that 48% of all reservations made at the WIL involved meeting rooms. This strong preference for larger conference rooms and open collaboration spaces highlights a key use case: coworker meetings rather than individual work.

Additionally, there was a notable trend of blocking out entire neighborhoods, reflecting a growing need for large gatherings that exceed the capacity of traditional conference rooms. The primary demand for these spaces stemmed from customers seeking environments conducive to large-scale collaboration and team-building events.**‍**

**Recommendation:** Future iterations of government coworking spaces should prioritize the allocation of additional meeting rooms and provide flexible accommodations for larger groups and events to meet this demand.

*   **90%** of the **top 10** rooms reserved have a **room capacity of 4 or more**
*   **70%** of the **bottom 10** rooms reserved have a **room capacity of 3 or less**‍
*   Customers much preferred an open, collaborative environment paired with the latest in innovative office technologies.

### Technology
As federal agencies are technology brand agnostic, it was critical for customers to have the ability to seamlessly access different meeting platforms (i.e. - Teams, Zoom, Google, Webex, etc.). Meeting rooms featured one-touch technology enabling visitors to effortlessly join web meetings and major events.

The latest in innovative conferencing devices included advanced video conferencing to enhance the hybrid experience. This resulted in an **80% satisfaction rate with the collaborative technologies featured.**

The reservation platform garnered a **favorable 84% satisfaction rate** from users. Throughout the duration, the reservation portal underwent iterative user experience configurations to facilitate user-friendly bookings through self-service, on-site kiosks, and modification options via a concierge portal.

The presence of a concierge played a pivotal role in providing essential on-site support, contributing to a successful customer experience (CX). A remarkable **90% of visitors** expressed **high satisfaction** with the technical assistance and on-site support .

‍

### Neighborhoods
Between the most popular neighborhoods, configurability, comfort, and collaborative layouts were by far the most preferred attributes. Additionally, the cohesive look and feel of each neighborhood also added to the overall coworking experience. Configurability became an increasingly importantamenity as neighborhoods in the WIL were configured to accommodate larger events and gatherings.

Consequently, we suggest future iterations to enable users to reserve a neighborhood instead of a specific desk, implementing a first-come, first-servedlogicwhile still managing occupancy in any given neighborhood.
