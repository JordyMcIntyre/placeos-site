## Project Overview

A Fortune Global 100 company needed to support a workplace strategy that balanced **local customization** with **global consistency**—spanning 150+ buildings, multiple continents, and vastly different cultures, regulations, and operational norms.

WorkMate was selected and deployed across their entire global real estate footprint, enabling scalable workplace operations while preserving regional autonomy.

## Objectives

* Respect local workplace policies, team preferences, and cultural norms
* Centralize oversight while allowing regional configuration
* Maintain a consistent employee experience regardless of integration stack
* Surface clean, actionable occupancy data across diverse systems

## Why WorkMate

Most workplace platforms force a tradeoff between global standardization and regional flexibility. This company needed both:

* The **ability to configure workflows, systems, and rules per location**
* The **ability to see what’s happening everywhere, in the same language**

WorkMate made that possible — without forcing teams into the same setup or stack. It worked across dozens of integrations, letting local teams work the way they wanted, while giving global leadership consistent visibility into how spaces were being used.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Multi-layer Configurability

Each building had different access control systems, workplace policies, environmental sensors, and cultural expectations. WorkMate allowed local teams to:

* Adjust workflows based on region-specific protocols
* Plug into preferred hardware and software stacks
* Manage space rules, booking flows, and alerts independently

### 2. Integration-Agnostic Occupancy Tracking

Despite using dozens of different sensor and platform vendors, the brand was able to:

* Normalize occupancy and presence data
* Preserve the employee experience without lag or conflicts
* Generate reliable data used for both local planning and global benchmarking

### 3. Outcome Consistency at Scale

While each location operated autonomously, the brand could:

* Track utilization trends across the portfolio
* Identify high-performing models and replicate best practices
* Optimize real estate footprint with confidence in the underlying data
