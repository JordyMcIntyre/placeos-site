## Project Overview
This pilot examined the implementation of PlaceOS for automating and synchronizing separate building systems—security access, HVAC, AV, and others—integrated with the university’s scheduling system. The goal was to transform classrooms into smart spaces through enhanced automation capabilities.

### Objectives:
*   Decrease energy consumption by using occupancy data & scheduling systems to optimize HVAC operations
*   Reduce reliance on manual controls
*   Monitor indoor environmental comfort and occupancy
*   Enhance room security and user experience
*   Avoid the necessity to replace existing infrastructure


## Features
*   Backoffice for system administration.
*   Analytics Dashboards using InfluxDB for space management and air quality data.
*   External System Integrations:
*   PlaceOS Drivers and Modules for seamless communication with external systems.

### Automation
Automations included triggering systems (e.g., HVAC, lighting) based on bookings and occupancy.

## Recommendations for expansion

*   Enhance logic to adapt automations based on real-time room occupancy to capture missed savings.
*   Collect more granular energy consumption and operational data to validate savings estimates.
*   Establish normalized metrics (e.g., Energy Use Intensity, energy per student) for broader scalability.
