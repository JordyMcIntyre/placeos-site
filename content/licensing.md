# Licensing
PlaceOS offers several licensing models depending on the solution’s requirements

## CapEx
Through a CAPEX model you can purchase a perpetual PlaceOS licence, which is a one-off payment providing you with ongoing and unlimited access to the full PlaceOS open source library of drivers, interfaces, resources and tier 3 support. This licence is based on the number of floors or SQM of your facility. Maintenance is paid separately as an annual fee.

## OpEx
Through an OPEX model you get access to a perpetual PlaceOS licence providing you with the same inclusions of the CAPEX model, but pay a monthly or annual ongoing fee that includes maintenance.

## Subscription
Subscription offerings of PlaceOS allow you to purchase a productized offering with limited functionality through a monthly or annual ongoing subscription. For this model, you don’t get access to the whole library, you just subscribe to a product of the one feature you need.
